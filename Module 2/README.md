### Concepts from Slides
- Programs communicate through **input()** and **print()** functions.  
- Literals represent fixed values: integers, floats, strings, booleans, None, lists, tuples, and dictionaries.  
- Integers and floats differ by the presence of a decimal point; Python uses a period `.` not a comma.  
- Numbers can also be written in **octal (0o)** and **hexadecimal (0x)** forms.  
- Strings are text enclosed in quotes; escape characters (like `\n` and `\t`) control formatting.  
- Operators perform calculations or logic:
  - Arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`
  - Shortcut: `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, etc.  
- Variables act as named containers for values, following naming conventions.  
- Comments (`#`) make code readable but are ignored by Python.  
- Python keywords (e.g., `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `and`) cannot be used as variable names.  
- Follow **PEP 8** guidelines for naming and code clarity.
