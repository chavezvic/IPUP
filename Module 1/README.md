### Concepts from Slides
- Programming is the process of designing and writing instructions that a computer can execute.  
- Logic is built on sequencing, decision-making, and iteration.  
- Pseudocode helps plan and visualize program logic before coding.  
- Computer languages have structure (alphabet, syntax, semantics).  
- Python is an interpreted, high-level, object-oriented language designed for readability and quick development.  
- Difference between **compilation** (translates once) and **interpretation** (translates each run).  
- Python was created by Guido van Rossum and named after “Monty Python’s Flying Circus.”  
- Key takeaway: Programming is like writing a recipe for the computer to follow.
