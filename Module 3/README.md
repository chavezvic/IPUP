### Concepts from Slides
- Programs make decisions using **Boolean logic** — True or False.  
- Comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`  
- Conditional statements:
  - `if` to test a condition  
  - `if...else` to define alternative paths  
  - `elif` for multiple conditions  
- Loops repeat tasks:
  - `while` continues while a condition is True  
  - `for` iterates through sequences or ranges  
- `break` exits a loop early; `continue` skips an iteration.  
- `for...else` and `while...else` add optional final actions after loops.  
- Logical operators:
  - `and`, `or`, `not` for combining conditions  
- Bitwise operators handle binary operations (`&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, `<<`, `>>`).  
- Lists allow storing multiple values, and can be indexed, sliced, or iterated.  
- Sorting (e.g., bubble sort) demonstrates algorithmic logic.
